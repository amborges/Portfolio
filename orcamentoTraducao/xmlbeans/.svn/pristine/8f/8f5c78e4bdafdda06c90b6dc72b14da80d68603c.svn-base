		<section name="Maven XMLBeans Plug-in">
			<p>This plugin is a wrapper to the xmlbean ant task (see 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans/">http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans/</a>
for more information on XMLBeans) which 
generates and compiles XMLBeans from XML Schema (*.xsd) files.
</p>
			<p>By default the plugin looks for the XML Schema files in the src/xmlbeans 
directory. Java source files for the generated XMLBeans are put into the 
target/xmlbeans/src directory. Class files and generated resource files are 
compiled into the target/classes directory. The plugin also creates a jar 
file (containing the generated class and resource files) which is put into
the target/xmlbeans directory.
</p>
			<section name="Dependencies">
				<p>You will need the XMLBean's xbean.jar file to use this plugin. You can get the
jar from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans/">http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans/</a>.
The project.xml currently will download the xbeans-1.0-DEV.jar from <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/xmlbeans/jars/">http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/xmlbeans/jars/</a>.
As new releases are made the dependency will have to changed in the project.xml
